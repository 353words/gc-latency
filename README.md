# gc-latency

Showing how you to use GC friendly data.

Use case: User store that returns user (string) from user ID (int).

- `users_map` uses a `map[int]string`
- `users_slice` use a `[]string` where the location on the slice is the ID
- `users_str` builds one big string with all user names and also have `indices []int` which hold the end index for each user

Run all with `make`
